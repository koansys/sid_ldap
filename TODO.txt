* SVN integration with apache
* ldaps instead of plaintext ldap to match AD server
* use mod_wsgi for Trac instead of mod_python since that's what we
  have in production mod_python (from examples found on web)
* HTTP Basic can't 'logout' of Trac effectively; but we already have
  this issue, or is it solved?


Done
